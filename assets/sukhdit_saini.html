	<p id="introduction">
	Welcome to my favourite weekend vacation destination page. Upon, analyzing between multiple holiday options, I concluded that Tobermory should be a prime vacation for weekends. Tobermory is a habour village located on Brunce Peninsula, Ontario. The name "Tobermory" is derived from the gaelic language which means the "Well of Mary". The water from Mary's well was said to possess medicinal properties. I believe this a prime location for a vacation since there are a wide range of options for activities.
