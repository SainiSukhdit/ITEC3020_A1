                <h2 id = "boggle">Boggle</h2>
                <p> The Boggle project was created in a group of 4. This project was assigned to me and my team for completion of a programming course. This game is developed intellij
                    using Javafx.  </br></br>Boggle is a 5x5 word-finding game for two or more players. In which you will be given random set of alphabets, you will then need to find as many words as possible.
                    The rules are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You may only connect alphabets horizontally, vertically or diagonally next to the selected alphabet. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may only find words that are valid to a dictonary. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p> My Tetris game has many functions. Firstly, there are player options. Specifically, you can allow a computer to play the game, or you can play the game yourself.
                    Secondly, at the very bottom of the tetris GUI, there is a speed bar. This speed bar adjusts the speed of which the block will fall. You may adjust the speed
                    in the range of 0 to 100, where 0 means the blocks are not falling and 100 meaning the blocks will fall at tis maximum speed. Additionally, there is an option to 
                    stop or start the game. These buttons are created with the purpose to stop the game and take a break. Finally, there are 3 buttons "Save", "Load" and "New Game".
                    These buttons allow the player to save the game at its current state, and reload the save game whenever the player wants to play. Furthermore, the player may click
                    the "New Game" button if they would like to play in a fresh board.
